# 10 Doctoral Researchers / Research Associate (m/f/d) on Self-Explaining Digitally Controlled Systems

The [**Research Training Group CAUSE**](https://www.tuhh.de/grk2972/) invites applications for doctoral researchers full time, fully funded  until finalizing the PhD degree for 3 years plus a potential extension of a fourth year. The remuneration is in accordance with [E13 TV-L](https://oeffentlicher-dienst.info/c/t/rechner/tv-l/allg?id=tv-l-2025&matrix=1). Positions start from November 1st, 2024.

The three universities [Hamburg University of Technology](https://www.tuhh.de/), [University of Bremen](https://www.uni-bremen.de/), and [Carl-von-Ossietzky University of Oldenburg](https://www.uol.de/) jointly run CAUSE. While your primary occupation will be with one of these three universities,  you will participate in an intense cooperation and exchange program with joint supervision by internationally renowned researchers from all three sites.

The acronym CAUSE expands to _Concepts and Algorithms for – and Usage of –
Self-Explaining Digitally Controlled Systems_. Digitally controlled systems are pervasive in our everyday life from transport to health-care. CAUSE aims at making digitally controlled systems self-explaining to the benefit of developers, operators, interoperability, and other systems. CAUSE is a research, education, and networking hub for future researchers. Topic-wise CAUSE covers all layers from system-of-systems over software stacks to digital hardware. Doctoral researchers in CAUSE will tightly interact to study cross-level effects of self-explanation considering a virtual wind park as a demonstrator.
