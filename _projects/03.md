title: Explanations in Hierarchical Control Schemes

We consider explanations exchanged between different levels within the hierarchical control of a CPES, specifically control of a single wind turbine, control of a wind farm, distribution grid control at the connection point of a wind farm, as well as transmission system operation and control. To resolve and translate conflicts at individual levels of operation with means from adjacent levels of control. The interaction within such a CPS 
between autonomous routines as well as expert operators requires justifications explaining relevant conflicts or failures within one domain to actors and systems within another domain. 
In energy systems regulatory unbinding forbids complicating factor is that, due to regulatory unbundling, certain information may not be exchanged 
exchange of certain information between power plant operators 
and network operators, so that explanations may have to be anonymised or particular information summarised or replaced on the basis of certain rules. 
Adding to this, in real-time operation it will also be important to be highly selective with regard to the nature of information passed between different layers as well as domains of control to guarantee focus and subsequently timely behaviour. Hence, it may be advisable to not explain specific aspects to a receiving system if it is not useful to the addressee, i.e.,~if there is nothing to be done to mitigate a problem from its specific domain of control.

<em>Desirable background and expertise</em>:
Knowledge in information systems, ontologies and/or multi-agent systems, as well as regulatory procedures in the energy sector.
