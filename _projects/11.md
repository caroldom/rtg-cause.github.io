Partial informedness stemming from local observation, confined
communication bandwidth, and protection of sensitive information is a
general constraint to intelligent agents in  open multi-agent
complex systems-of-systems. Understanding the  diverse
information frames induced by such partial informedness obviously 
is
instrumental to determining the need for and comprehensibility of an
explanation by an addressee agent, as well as for evaluating the
ability of an explainer agent to determine such need and to generate a
suitable explanation. However, astonishingly little research has been pursued
addressing this  particular
problem. 
The distributed detection of operational conflicts in the emergent
joint behaviour of multi-agent systems and the generation of
action-oriented explanations resolving such conflicts remain hard and
mostly unsolved computational problems.
