title: Self-Explaining Digital Hardware using Temporal Specifications 
lead: fey
---

Explaining all hardware behaviour at any time during runtime is infeasible due to overhead, processing speed, and limited data bandwidth. Instead,
we assume a decision and/or analysis at design time  
fixing what is to be explained. By this, we can pre-calculate the model for explaining past and future behaviour online. Behaviour to be explained is specified by temporal logic  at design time.
