We consider explanations of adaptive software, that adapts its behaviour to dynamic changes in the execution context to satisfy goals/control objectives that might be context-dependent as well and possibly conflicting, thus, requiring dynamic trade-off decisions. In such a complex setting, the resulting software behaviour and the effect of single design decisions is hard to predict. Furthermore, if the behaviour of the software changes at run-time, operators need to understand the reasons and effects of this in order to be able to predict the future performance and to intervene where necessary.
