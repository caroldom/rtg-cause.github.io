We will 
transfer modern 
Knowledge Representation and Reasoning
(KR&R) techniques 
for introspective reasoning and self-programming
invented in the field of 
cognitive robotics to the problem domain of
self-explanation. These KR&R techniques, called digital twin
Knowledge Representation & Reasoning (dtKR&R), 
KR&R (dtKR&R), 
enable robot agents
to accomplish 
serve
underdetermined task 
requests such as ''set the table''
and ''bring me something to drink'', to perform an
action without causing 
unwanted side effects, and understand what they 
are doing, why, and how. 
They represent robots and their environments, that is 
a
subclass of CPSs, as virtual reality scene graphs,
which facilitate the photo-realistic rendering and physical simulation. 
dtKR&R also links substructures of the scene
graph to ontologies and thereby make 
making
the substructures
machine-understandable and -interpretable.
