Digitally controlled systems consist of 
software and hardware
components and, hence, are developed by interdisciplinary developer
teams. If the root cause for an unexpected behaviour must be located,
For root causing unexpected behaviour,
more often than not, the interplay between those 
software and hardware
components needs to be understood. Likewise, if any 
of the components
needs to be changed (for improvement, adding a feature, or just 
fixing
a defect), the potential impact of those changes 
on other software or
hardware components needs to be assessed. The basis of any such
assessment is a thorough understanding of interrelations among the
involved software and hardware 
components. Generally, developers are
not aware of all interrelations simply 
because the system is too large
and full of low-level details and, specifically for interdisciplinary
developer teams, because software developers may not have the
necessary expertise for hardware and, vice versa, hardware developers
may not have the full insights into the details of the software.

Interdisciplinary developer teams would benefit from automated program
analyses providing them complete and precise explanations of the
interrelations in digitally controlled systems 
at the right level of
abstraction.
