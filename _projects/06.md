We consider explanations of low level software in situations with failure. 
We assume a model-based design for software with contracts, i.e. specifications software components specified 
via pre- and postconditions. 
 For given contracts,  we will apply software verification. 
 More precisely, for a component C with given preconditions, we employ automatic verification tools for proving Hoare triples. Realistically, contracts can 
 only cover standard situations and thus will most likely be partial. Within this project, we develop explanations for countercontractual behaviour 
 in exceptional situations. More precisely, we aim at performing a <em> blame analysis</em> which determines the root cause  of a contract violation (which component is faulty? which pre- or postconditions are broken?).
