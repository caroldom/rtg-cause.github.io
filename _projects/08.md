title: Explanations of Dynamic Run-Time Resource Allocations
lead: falk
---

In modern
embedded devices, the Operating System (OS) considers non-functional properties such as performance, energy efficiency,
timeliness,
or code size resulting in
counter-intuitive resource allocation
decisions dynamically
taken by an OS
at runtime, e.g., sacrificing performance for energy savings.
We will provide online explanations for such counter-intuitive runtime 
decisions by exploiting design-time information provided by 
of
an optimising compiler.
