On 12th February 2025, [Ulrike Engeln](https://rtg-cause.github.io/people/engeln) presented her talk 'Executable Explanations of Control Software' at the Trustworthy Systems Lab Seminar series at the University of Bristol. In her presentation, Engeln introduced the CAUSE approach, which enables cyber-physical system controllers to explain their behavior. The talk motivated the abstract explanation pattern introduced by CAUSE, illustrated the concept of explanations for control software (where explanations are executable networks of timed automata), and presented the first research results on online piecewise approximation of control outputs.
