title: First CAUSE Meeting Successfully Concludes at TUHH
---

We are pleased to announce the successful conclusion of the first CAUSE meeting, held on November 21st, 2024, at the Hamburg University of Technology (TUHH). The event brought together CAUSE fellows and principal investigators from across Oldenburg, Bremen, and Hamburg.

This inaugural gathering provided an excellent opportunity for participants to meet in person, fostering connections and collaboration within the CAUSE community. Attendees shared their previous experiences and presented upcoming projects, sparking insightful discussions and setting the stage for future joint efforts.

We are excited to share that the next CAUSE retreat has been scheduled for January 15th to 17th, 2025.
