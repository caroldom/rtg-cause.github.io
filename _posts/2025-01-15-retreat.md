title: Our first retreat in Bremerv√∂rde
---

We're having our first retreat of 3 days. The program is packed with updating each other on the current state and next steps of each project. We are also starting to work on our demonstrator and identify topics for joint research work on subtopics. Moreover, we are creating our data management plan.
