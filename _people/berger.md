Dr Bernhard J. Berger conducts research in the field of software and system security as well as software quality. Explainability is a relevant aspect in these research areas. In addition to the explainability of results to developers and users, the explainability of security properties between systems is also important. Information about possible security problems of dependent systems can be used to improve and ensure the security and availability of the entire system. At the same time, such explanations are themselves security-relevant information that must be taken into account when creating a threat model for overall system security.
