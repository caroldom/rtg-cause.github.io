Ole Lübke is a PhD Candidate at TUHH's Institute for Software Systems focusing on the Maximum Satisfiability Problem (MaxSAT) in real-time contexts. While applicable to a wide range of diverse applications, MaxSAT can be useful for generating minimal, human understandable formal explanations of system behavior. Providing such explanations in real-time could allow for their immediate examination.
