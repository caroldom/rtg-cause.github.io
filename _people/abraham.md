Erika Abraham graduated in Computer Science at the Christian-Albrechts-University Kiel (Germany), and received her PhD from the University of Leiden (the Netherlands) for her work on the verification of concurrent programs. Then she moved to the Albert-Ludwigs-University Freiburg (Germany), where she started to work on the automated solution of arithmetic problems via SAT and SMT solvers, and the integration of these tools in formal methods for cyber-physical systems. Since 2008 she is professor at RWTH Aachen University (Germany), with main research focus on formal methods for probabilistic and hybrid systems, and SMT solving for real and integer arithmetic.
