Caroline Dominik is a doctoral researcher at the University of Bremen.
As a fellow of CAUSE, her focus is integrating explainability into virtual prototypes, predominantly written in SystemC.
With this high-level representation of hardware, it is possible to analyze the interaction of hardware and low-level software and enable HW/SW Co-Design for the design flow of systems.
She is researching, how to add self-explanations into virtual prototypes and how to verify them.
She is further interested in using these self-explanations for the verification of low-level software.
